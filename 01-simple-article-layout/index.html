  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <div class="acquire"><p>Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In 2014, <span style="color: skyblue">we were acquired by Monotype</span>.</p></div>

  <div class="backpat"><p>Over the years, <span style="color: skyblue">we built an amazing team</span> and worked on some <span style="color: skyblue">tremendous projects with the smartest clients</span>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful for. But it's time for a change.</p></div>

  <div class="future"><p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix. Mark Boulton Design is now closed. The team will be working on Monotype projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, still blogging, and still be speaking at web conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p></div>
